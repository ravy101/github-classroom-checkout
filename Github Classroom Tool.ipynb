    "# Github Classroom Workshop Checkout Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a tool to checkout all of the student github repositories for one or more workshops.  It\n",
    "assumes that you have password-less checkout configured for github using a public/private key pair.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires two files to drive the process:\n",
    "* The gradebook downloaded from iLearn as a CSV file (in gradebook, choose _Export_ and then choose _Plain Text File_.   \n",
    "* The Github Classroom roster, downloaded from Github Classroom\n",
    "* A csv file listing the Github repositories generated by the get-repos.py script\n",
    "\n",
    "These should be saved in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will then checkout each github repository and store it in a directory named for the workshop and a subdirectory named for the student ID.  Eg. `submissions/Workshop_1|FRI|01:00PM|C13/46457771`.  If you run this a second time, and the repository already exists, it will just do a pull from Github to update the repository with more recent work.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once either the checkout or pull is complete, the script runs `nbconvert` on all notebook files in the repository to convert them to HTML.  It then outputs a list of links to the HTML files in the notebook below.  You can click on each link and it will be opened in a new window.   This should be quicker than opening the notebook file itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "I've included a list of all workshop names just for reference, choose your workshops from this list and update the config.\n"
